## About
This webpage is a demonstration of a modal using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The modal is activated when the 'Where's our Modal?' button is clicked and deactivated when the '`x`' is clicked or anywhere on the page.

This project was built as part of the [JavaScript DOM Manipulation â€“ Full Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/5fb2aPlgoys) taught by CodeLab and hosted by freeCodeCamp. This project was created as part of my participation in the [#100DaysOfCode Challenge](https://github.com/ananfito/100-days-of-code).
